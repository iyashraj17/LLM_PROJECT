The Loan Approval System using LLMs is a machine learning project developed in Python on Jupyter Notebook. It leverages different Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Using historical loan data, the system analyzes key factors such as credit score, income, and loan amount. It then compares the performance of various models, optimizing accuracy. The final model provides automated predictions, assisting financial institutions in loan approval decisions.
